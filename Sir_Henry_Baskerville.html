<p>Our breakfast-table was cleared early, and Holmes waited in his
dressing-gown for the promised interview. Our clients were
punctual to their appointment, for the clock had just struck ten
when Dr. Mortimer was shown up, followed by the young baronet.
The latter was a small, alert, dark-eyed man about thirty years
of age, very sturdily built, with thick black eyebrows and a
strong, pugnacious face. He wore a ruddy-tinted tweed suit and
had the weather-beaten appearance of one who has spent most of
his time in the open air, and yet there was something in his
steady eye and the quiet assurance of his bearing which indicated
the gentleman.</p>
<p>&quot;This is Sir Henry Baskerville,&quot; said Dr. Mortimer.</p>
<p>&quot;Why, yes,&quot; said he, &quot;and the strange thing is, Mr. Sherlock
Holmes, that if my friend here had not proposed coming round to
you this morning I should have come on my own account. I
understand that you think out little puzzles, and I've had one
this morning which wants more thinking out than I am able to give
it.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Pray take a seat, Sir Henry. Do I understand you to say that you
have yourself had some remarkable experience since you arrived in
London?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Nothing of much importance, Mr. Holmes. Only a joke, as like as
not. It was this letter, if you can call it a letter, which
reached me this morning.&quot;</p>
<p>He laid an envelope upon the table, and we all bent over it. It
was of common quality, grayish in colour. The address, &quot;Sir Henry
Baskerville, Northumberland Hotel,&quot; was printed in rough
characters; the postmark &quot;Charing Cross,&quot; and the date of posting
the preceding evening.</p>
<p>&quot;Who knew that you were going to the Northumberland Hotel?&quot; asked
Holmes, glancing keenly across at our visitor.</p>
<p>&quot;No one could have known. We only decided after I met Dr.
Mortimer.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;But Dr. Mortimer was no doubt already stopping there?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;No, I had been staying with a friend,&quot; said the doctor. &quot;There
was no possible indication that we intended to go to this hotel.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Hum! Someone seems to be very deeply interested in your
movements.&quot; Out of the envelope he took a half-sheet of foolscap
paper folded into four. This he opened and spread flat upon the
table. Across the middle of it a single sentence had been formed
by the expedient of pasting printed words upon it. It ran: &quot;As
you value your life or your reason keep away from the moor.&quot; The
word &quot;moor&quot; only was printed in ink.</p>
<p>&quot;Now,&quot; said Sir Henry Baskerville, &quot;perhaps you will tell me, Mr.
Holmes, what in thunder is the meaning of that, and who it is
that takes so much interest in my affairs?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;What do you make of it, Dr. Mortimer? You must allow that there
is nothing supernatural about this, at any rate?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;No, sir, but it might very well come from someone who was
convinced that the business is supernatural.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;What business?&quot; asked Sir Henry sharply. &quot;It seems to me that
all you gentlemen know a great deal more than I do about my own
affairs.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You shall share our knowledge before you leave this room, Sir
Henry. I promise you that,&quot; said Sherlock Holmes. &quot;We will
confine ourselves for the present with your permission to this
very interesting document, which must have been put together and
posted yesterday evening. Have you yesterday's Times, Watson?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;It is here in the corner.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Might I trouble you for it--the inside page, please, with the
leading articles?&quot; He glanced swiftly over it, running his eyes
up and down the columns. &quot;Capital article this on free trade.
Permit me to give you an extract from it. 'You may be cajoled
into imagining that your own special trade or your own industry
will be encouraged by a protective tariff, but it stands to
reason that such legislation must in the long run keep away
wealth from the country, diminish the value of our imports, and
lower the general conditions of life in this island.' What do you
think of that, Watson?&quot; cried Holmes in high glee, rubbing his
hands together with satisfaction. &quot;Don't you think that is an
admirable sentiment?&quot;</p>
<p>Dr. Mortimer looked at Holmes with an air of professional
interest, and Sir Henry Baskerville turned a pair of puzzled dark
eyes upon me.</p>
<p>&quot;I don't know much about the tariff and things of that kind,&quot;
said he; &quot;but it seems to me we've got a bit off the trail so far
as that note is concerned.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;On the contrary, I think we are particularly hot upon the trail,
Sir Henry. Watson here knows more about my methods than you do,
but I fear that even he has not quite grasped the significance of
this sentence.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;No, I confess that I see no connection.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;And yet, my dear Watson, there is so very close a connection
that the one is extracted out of the other. 'You,' 'your,'
'your,' 'life,' 'reason,' 'value,' 'keep away,' 'from the.' Don't
you see now whence these words have been taken?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;By thunder, you're right! Well, if that isn't smart!&quot; cried Sir
Henry.</p>
<p>&quot;If any possible doubt remained it is settled by the fact that
'keep away' and 'from the' are cut out in one piece.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Well, now--so it is!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Really, Mr. Holmes, this exceeds anything which I could have
imagined,&quot; said Dr. Mortimer, gazing at my friend in amazement.
&quot;I could understand anyone saying that the words were from a
newspaper; but that you should name which, and add that it came
from the leading article, is really one of the most remarkable
things which I have ever known. How did you do it?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I presume, Doctor, that you could tell the skull of a negro from
that of an Esquimau?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Most certainly.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;But how?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Because that is my special hobby. The differences are obvious.
The supra-orbital crest, the facial angle, the maxillary curve,
the --&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;But this is my special hobby, and the differences are equally
obvious. There is as much difference to my eyes between the
leaded bourgeois type of a Times article and the slovenly print
of an evening half-penny paper as there could be between your
negro and your Esquimau. The detection of types is one of the
most elementary branches of knowledge to the special expert in
crime, though I confess that once when I was very young I
confused the Leeds Mercury with the Western Morning News. But a
Times leader is entirely distinctive, and these words could have
been taken from nothing else. As it was done yesterday the strong
probability was that we should find the words in yesterday's
issue.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;So far as I can follow you, then, Mr. Holmes,&quot; said Sir Henry
Baskerville, &quot;someone cut out this message with a scissors--&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Nail-scissors,&quot; said Holmes. &quot;You can see that it was a very
short-bladed scissors, since the cutter had to take two snips
over 'keep away.'&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;That is so. Someone, then, cut out the message with a pair of
short-bladed scissors, pasted it with paste--&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Gum,&quot; said Holmes.</p>
<p>&quot;With gum on to the paper. But I want to know why the word 'moor'
should have been written?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Because he could not find it in print. The other words were all
simple and might be found in any issue, but 'moor' would be less
common.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Why, of course, that would explain it. Have you read anything
else in this message, Mr. Holmes?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;There are one or two indications, and yet the utmost pains have
been taken to remove all clues. The address, you observe is
printed in rough characters. But the Times is a paper which is
seldom found in any hands but those of the highly educated. We
may take it, therefore, that the letter was composed by an
educated man who wished to pose as an uneducated one, and his
effort to conceal his own writing suggests that that writing
might be known, or come to be known, by you. Again, you will
observe that the words are not gummed on in an accurate line, but
that some are much higher than others. 'Life,' for example is
quite out of its proper place. That may point to carelessness or
it may point to agitation and hurry upon the part of the cutter.
On the whole I incline to the latter view, since the matter was
evidently important, and it is unlikely that the composer of such
a letter would be careless. If he were in a hurry it opens up the
interesting question why he should be in a hurry, since any
letter posted up to early morning would reach Sir Henry before he
would leave his hotel. Did the composer fear an interruption--and
from whom?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;We are coming now rather into the region of guesswork,&quot; said Dr.
Mortimer.</p>
<p>&quot;Say, rather, into the region where we balance probabilities and
choose the most likely. It is the scientific use of the
imagination, but we have always some material basis on which to
start our speculation. Now, you would call it a guess, no doubt,
but I am almost certain that this address has been written in a
hotel.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;How in the world can you say that?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;If you examine it carefully you will see that both the pen and
the ink have given the writer trouble. The pen has spluttered
twice in a single word, and has run dry three times in a short
address, showing that there was very little ink in the bottle.
Now, a private pen or ink-bottle is seldom allowed to be in such
a state, and the combination of the two must be quite rare. But
you know the hotel ink and the hotel pen, where it is rare to get
anything else. Yes, I have very little hesitation in saying that
could we examine the waste-paper baskets of the hotels around
Charing Cross until we found the remains of the mutilated Times
leader we could lay our hands straight upon the person who sent
this singular message. Halloa! Halloa! What's this?&quot;</p>
<p>He was carefully examining the foolscap, upon which the words
were pasted, holding it only an inch or two from his eyes.</p>
<p>&quot;Well?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Nothing,&quot; said he, throwing it down. &quot;It is a blank half-sheet
of paper, without even a water-mark upon it. I think we have
drawn as much as we can from this curious letter; and now, Sir
Henry, has anything else of interest happened to you since you
have been in London?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Why, no, Mr. Holmes. I think not.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You have not observed anyone follow or watch you?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I seem to have walked right into the thick of a dime novel,&quot;
said our visitor. &quot;Why in thunder should anyone follow or watch
me?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;We are coming to that. You have nothing else to report to us
before we go into this matter?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Well, it depends upon what you think worth reporting.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I think anything out of the ordinary routine of life well worth
reporting.&quot;</p>
<p>Sir Henry smiled.</p>
<p>&quot;I don't know much of British life yet, for I have spent nearly
all my time in the States and in Canada. But I hope that to lose
one of your boots is not part of the ordinary routine of life
over here.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You have lost one of your boots?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;My dear sir,&quot; cried Dr. Mortimer, &quot;it is only mislaid. You will
find it when you return to the hotel. What is the use of
troubling Mr. Holmes with trifles of this kind?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Well, he asked me for anything outside the ordinary routine.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Exactly,&quot; said Holmes, &quot;however foolish the incident may seem.
You have lost one of your boots, you say?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Well, mislaid it, anyhow. I put them both outside my door last
night, and there was only one in the morning. I could get no
sense out of the chap who cleans them. The worst of it is that I
only bought the pair last night in the Strand, and I have never
had them on.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;If you have never worn them, why did you put them out to be
cleaned?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;They were tan boots and had never been varnished. That was why I
put them out.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Then I understand that on your arrival in London yesterday you
went out at once and bought a pair of boots?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I did a good deal of shopping. Dr. Mortimer here went round with
me. You see, if I am to be squire down there I must dress the
part, and it may be that I have got a little careless in my ways
out West. Among other things I bought these brown boots--gave six
dollars for them--and had one stolen before ever I had them on my
feet.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;It seems a singularly useless thing to steal,&quot; said Sherlock
Holmes. &quot;I confess that I share Dr. Mortimer's belief that it
will not be long before the missing boot is found.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;And, now, gentlemen,&quot; said the baronet with decision, &quot;it seems
to me that I have spoken quite enough about the little that I
know. It is time that you kept your promise and gave me a full
account of what we are all driving at.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Your request is a very reasonable one,&quot; Holmes answered. &quot;Dr.
Mortimer, I think you could not do better than to tell your story
as you told it to us.&quot;</p>
<p>Thus encouraged, our scientific friend drew his papers from his
pocket, and presented the whole case as he had done upon the
morning before. Sir Henry Baskerville listened with the deepest
attention, and with an occasional exclamation of surprise.</p>
<p>&quot;Well, I seem to have come into an inheritance with a vengeance,&quot;
said he when the long narrative was finished. &quot;Of course, I've
heard of the hound ever since I was in the nursery. It's the pet
story of the family, though I never thought of taking it
seriously before. But as to my uncle's death--well, it all seems
boiling up in my head, and I can't get it clear yet. You don't
seem quite to have made up your mind whether it's a case for a
policeman or a clergyman.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Precisely.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;And now there's this affair of the letter to me at the hotel. I
suppose that fits into its place.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;It seems to show that someone knows more than we do about what
goes on upon the moor,&quot; said Dr. Mortimer.</p>
<p>&quot;And also,&quot; said Holmes, &quot;that someone is not ill-disposed
towards you, since they warn you of danger.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Or it may be that they wish, for their own purposes, to scare me
away.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Well, of course, that is possible also. I am very much indebted
to you, Dr. Mortimer, for introducing me to a problem which
presents several interesting alternatives. But the practical
point which we now have to decide, Sir Henry, is whether it is or
is not advisable for you to go to Baskerville Hall.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Why should I not go?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;There seems to be danger.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Do you mean danger from this family fiend or do you mean danger
from human beings?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Well, that is what we have to find out.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Whichever it is, my answer is fixed. There is no devil in hell,
Mr. Holmes, and there is no man upon earth who can prevent me
from going to the home of my own people, and you may take that to
be my final answer.&quot; His dark brows knitted and his face flushed
to a dusky red as he spoke. It was evident that the fiery temper
of the Baskervilles was not extinct in this their last
representative. &quot;Meanwhile,&quot; said he, &quot;I have hardly had time to
think over all that you have told me. It's a big thing for a man
to have to understand and to decide at one sitting. I should like
to have a quiet hour by myself to make up my mind. Now, look
here, Mr. Holmes, it's half-past eleven now and I am going back
right away to my hotel. Suppose you and your friend, Dr. Watson,
come round and lunch with us at two. I'll be able to tell you
more clearly then how this thing strikes me.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Is that convenient to you, Watson?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Perfectly.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Then you may expect us. Shall I have a cab called?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I'd prefer to walk, for this affair has flurried me rather.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I'll join you in a walk, with pleasure,&quot; said his companion.</p>
<p>&quot;Then we meet again at two o'clock. Au revoir, and good-morning!&quot;</p>
<p>We heard the steps of our visitors descend the stair and the bang
of the front door. In an instant Holmes had changed from the
languid dreamer to the man of action.</p>
<p>&quot;Your hat and boots, Watson, quick! Not a moment to lose!&quot; He
rushed into his room in his dressing-gown and was back again in a
few seconds in a frock-coat. We hurried together down the stairs
and into the street. Dr. Mortimer and Baskerville were still
visible about two hundred yards ahead of us in the direction of
Oxford Street.</p>
<p>&quot;Shall I run on and stop them?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Not for the world, my dear Watson. I am perfectly satisfied with
your company if you will tolerate mine. Our friends are wise, for
it is certainly a very fine morning for a walk.&quot;</p>
<p>He quickened his pace until we had decreased the distance which
divided us by about half. Then, still keeping a hundred yards
behind, we followed into Oxford Street and so down Regent Street.
Once our friends stopped and stared into a shop window, upon
which Holmes did the same. An instant afterwards he gave a little
cry of satisfaction, and, following the direction of his eager
eyes, I saw that a hansom cab with a man inside which had halted
on the other side of the street was now proceeding slowly onward
again.</p>
<p>&quot;There's our man, Watson! Come along! We'll have a good look at
him, if we can do no more.&quot;</p>
<p>At that instant I was aware of a bushy black beard and a pair of
piercing eyes turned upon us through the side window of the cab.
Instantly the trapdoor at the top flew up, something was screamed
to the driver, and the cab flew madly off down Regent Street.
Holmes looked eagerly round for another, but no empty one was in
sight. Then he dashed in wild pursuit amid the stream of the
traffic, but the start was too great, and already the cab was out
of sight.</p>
<p>&quot;There now!&quot; said Holmes bitterly as he emerged panting and white
with vexation from the tide of vehicles. &quot;Was ever such bad luck
and such bad management, too? Watson, Watson, if you are an
honest man you will record this also and set it against my
successes!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Who was the man?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I have not an idea.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;A spy?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Well, it was evident from what we have heard that Baskerville
has been very closely shadowed by someone since he has been in
town. How else could it be known so quickly that it was the
Northumberland Hotel which he had chosen? If they had followed
him the first day I argued that they would follow him also the
second. You may have observed that I twice strolled over to the
window while Dr. Mortimer was reading his legend.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yes, I remember.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I was looking out for loiterers in the street, but I saw none.
We are dealing with a clever man, Watson. This matter cuts very
deep, and though I have not finally made up my mind whether it is
a benevolent or a malevolent agency which is in touch with us, I
am conscious always of power and design. When our friends left I
at once followed them in the hopes of marking down their
invisible attendant. So wily was he that he had not trusted
himself upon foot, but he had availed himself of a cab so that he
could loiter behind or dash past them and so escape their notice.
His method had the additional advantage that if they were to take
a cab he was all ready to follow them. It has, however, one
obvious disadvantage.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;It puts him in the power of the cabman.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Exactly.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;What a pity we did not get the number!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;My dear Watson, clumsy as I have been, you surely do not
seriously imagine that I neglected to get the number? No. 2704 is
our man. But that is no use to us for the moment.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I fail to see how you could have done more.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;On observing the cab I should have instantly turned and walked
in the other direction. I should then at my leisure have hired a
second cab and followed the first at a respectful distance, or,
better still, have driven to the Northumberland Hotel and waited
there. When our unknown had followed Baskerville home we should
have had the opportunity of playing his own game upon himself and
seeing where he made for. As it is, by an indiscreet eagerness,
which was taken advantage of with extraordinary quickness and
energy by our opponent, we have betrayed ourselves and lost our
man.&quot;</p>
<p>We had been sauntering slowly down Regent Street during this
conversation, and Dr. Mortimer, with his companion, had long
vanished in front of us.</p>
<p>&quot;There is no object in our following them,&quot; said Holmes. &quot;The
shadow has departed and will not return. We must see what further
cards we have in our hands and play them with decision. Could you
swear to that man's face within the cab?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I could swear only to the beard.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;And so could I--from which I gather that in all probability it
was a false one. A clever man upon so delicate an errand has no
use for a beard save to conceal his features. Come in here,
Watson!&quot;</p>
<p>He turned into one of the district messenger offices, where he
was warmly greeted by the manager.</p>
<p>&quot;Ah, Wilson, I see you have not forgotten the little case in
which I had the good fortune to help you?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;No, sir, indeed I have not. You saved my good name, and perhaps
my life.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;My dear fellow, you exaggerate. I have some recollection,
Wilson, that you had among your boys a lad named Cartwright, who
showed some ability during the investigation.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yes, sir, he is still with us.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Could you ring him up?--thank you! And I should be glad to have
change of this five-pound note.&quot;</p>
<p>A lad of fourteen, with a bright, keen face, had obeyed the
summons of the manager. He stood now gazing with great reverence
at the famous detective.</p>
<p>&quot;Let me have the Hotel Directory,&quot; said Holmes. &quot;Thank you! Now,
Cartwright, there are the names of twenty-three hotels here, all
in the immediate neighbourhood of Charing Cross. Do you see?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yes, sir.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You will visit each of these in turn.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yes, sir.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You will begin in each case by giving the outside porter one
shilling. Here are twenty-three shillings.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yes, sir.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You will tell him that you want to see the waste-paper of
yesterday. You will say that an important telegram has miscarried
and that you are looking for it. You understand?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yes, sir.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;But what you are really looking for is the centre page of the
Times with some holes cut in it with scissors. Here is a copy of
the Times. It is this page. You could easily recognize it, could
you not?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yes, sir.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;In each case the outside porter will send for the hall porter,
to whom also you will give a shilling. Here are twenty-three
shillings. You will then learn in possibly twenty cases out of
the twenty-three that the waste of the day before has been burned
or removed. In the three other cases you will be shown a heap of
paper and you will look for this page of the Times among it. The
odds are enormously against your finding it. There are ten
shillings over in case of emergencies. Let me have a report by
wire at Baker Street before evening. And now, Watson, it only
remains for us to find out by wire the identity of the cabman,
No. 2704, and then we will drop into one of the Bond Street
picture galleries and fill in the time until we are due at the
hotel.&quot;</p>
